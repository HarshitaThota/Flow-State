# Flow State Research Notes

*Compiled from research on what women actually need from health/productivity apps*

---

## Key Problems with Existing Apps

### 1. Accuracy Issues
- Only 13-16% of women have a 28-day cycle, yet most apps assume this
- Apps are least accurate for people who need them most (irregular cycles)
- When predictions are wrong, women doubt themselves instead of the app

### 2. Design Problems
- "Shrink it and pink it" - patronizing, flowery designs
- Not discrete - anyone can tell what the app is
- Women want functional, professional design

### 3. Reductive View of Women's Health
- Focus only on fertility/pregnancy
- Ignore that cycles affect energy, mood, cognition daily
- Miss the intersection of menstruation with nutrition, sleep, exercise

### 4. Mental Health Ignored
- PMDD affects up to 50% of women, apps barely acknowledge it
- No severity ratings for symptoms
- No "I need help now" features
- No connection between mood patterns and cycle phases

### 5. Privacy Concerns
- Many apps sell data to third parties
- Post-Roe concerns about data being used against women
- Inadequate security practices

## The Mental Load Crisis

- Women experience burnout at higher rates than men
- "Double shift" - work all day, then manage household
- Emotional labor: comforting colleagues, remembering birthdays, fostering culture
- These tasks rarely in job descriptions or evaluations
- Productivity advice often doesn't account for women's realities

---

## What Women Actually Want

### From Period/Cycle Apps:
- Track moods, energy, sleep, cravings, digestion, skin, weight
- Support for PCOS, endometriosis, PMDD, chronic pain
- Customizable predictions (TTC vs avoiding pregnancy)
- Privacy-first (data stays on device or GDPR-compliant)
- Discrete design - "No one would guess what my app was about"
- Inclusive (not assuming heterosexual, cisgender users)

### From Self-Care Apps:
- Actually free core features (not everything behind paywall)
- 24/7 support/chat when struggling
- Community of women in similar situations
- Personalized, not generic advice
- Acknowledges the mental load women carry

### From Productivity Apps:
- Recognition that energy fluctuates (not just willpower)
- Work WITH their body, not against it
- Don't just say "hire help" - acknowledge the mental work in that too
- Boundaries and saying no as valid strategies

## Body Literacy

Definition: "Having self-knowledge gained by learning to observe and chart scientifically proven signs, as well as other health and wellness observations."

Benefits:
- Fosters positive conversations around reproductive health
- Informed decision-making
- Women's empowerment
- Better conversations with healthcare providers
- Shared decision-making with doctors

Key insight: Women don't just need to TRACK - they need to UNDERSTAND.

## PMDD Support Requirements

What's needed:
- Symptom tracking with severity ratings (0-3)
- PMDD-specific questions
- Treatment tracking
- Self-love/gratitude journal
- Resources section
- "I Need Help Now" button
- Pattern recognition over multiple cycles
- Ability to generate reports for doctors

User quote: "It wasn't until I noticed the pattern with the analysis that I began to associate it with my cycle."

## What a Caring App Would Do

### Validation, Not Judgment
- "Your pain is real and valid"
- "Your feelings aren't crazy - that's biology"
- "Rest is productive"

### Education, Not Just Tracking
- Explain WHY you feel certain ways
- Connect symptoms to cycle phases
- Teach body literacy

### Support on Hard Days
- "I'm struggling" button
- Grounding exercises
- Emergency resources
- Gentle reminders to be kind to yourself

### Celebrate, Not Just Warn
- "Your energy peaks this week!"
- Not just "PMS incoming - brace yourself"

### Privacy as Sacred
- Data encryption
- No selling, no sharing
- GDPR compliant
- Clear about what's stored and where

## Design Principles

1. **Discrete** - No one knows what app this is from a glance
2. **Warm but not patronizing** - Like a wise friend
3. **Beautiful but functional** - Not pink flowers, genuinely calming
4. **Privacy-first** - Encryption, no third parties
5. **Inclusive** - All gender identities, sexualities, life stages
6. **Grows with user** - First period to menopause
